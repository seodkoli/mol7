<p>Another potential cost to consider is a commission or referral fee. Some mortgage brokers receive compensation from lenders for referring clients to them or for securing a loan on their behalf. While this can help keep costs down for you as the borrower, it's important to be aware of any potential conflicts of interest that may arise from these arrangements. It's also worth noting that some mortgage brokers work on a commission-only basis, meaning they only get paid if they successfully secure a loan for you. In these cases, there may not be any upfront fees, but you should still confirm how much commission they will earn from your loan and ensure that it aligns with industry standards. Ultimately, when choosing a mortgage broker in Hobart, it's essential to consider not just the fees they charge but also the quality of service they provide and their track record of success in securing favorable loan terms for their clients. <br><br>  What sets apart top-rated mortgage brokers in Hobart from others?
